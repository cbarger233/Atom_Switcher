This program takes a CONTCAR file and replaces either:
	1) C-H bonds with Si-H bonds,
	2) Si-H bonds with C-H bonds,
	3) Si-C bonds with Si-Si bonds, or
	4) Si-C bonds with C-C bonds.

The new file is called POSCAR.

Compile the program with make while in the Atom_Switcher directory.
Run the program with ./hello while in the directory.



Example program run (old):

Would you like to replace bonded Carbon with Silicon (1), or bonded Silicon with Carbon (2)?
1
How many of the 12 bonded Carbons would you like to replace?
11

This example takes a model that has 12 Carbons bonded to hydrogen atoms and replaces the carbon wth silicon, forming at least one Si-Si bond and at least one Si-H bond in the process.
